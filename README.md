This was a final project for the CourseCareers Software Development course. 
The goal was to create a project that somehow involved connecting a frontend to a backend. 
Partway through developing this project, I realized that it would probably work better as just a frontend app, so I moved forward and finished it that way.
After finishing it, I put together what would've been a Go backend and shoehorned some api calls into the frontend in some comments as demonstration that I have at least some idea how to work with a backend.
The working project does not utilize that Go file or any backend though. The Go file is just there in an attempt to satisfy the requirements of the final project.

Anyway, a family friend gave me the idea for this project. It's based on an app called 30/30 that she and many others used to love but then became unavailable.
The app mainly functions as series of cascading timers. You can create a series of tasks, each with their own title and timer.
Once one task's timer finishes, the next task's timer automatically starts. Some people with ADHD find this helpful for focusing on different tasks in chunks. 
For example, someone may set timers to do housework for 30 minutes, read for 30, homework for 30, and then take a break for 15, with a little timer ding between each task.
This is the first big coding project I've ever worked on, and I'm sure it shows. 
The UI is simple, my code is probably messy and inconsistent by professional standards, but it works and I have a project under my belt, which is cool.
I'm not sure how much more I'll work on it, if at all
